# Cats and Dogs Deep Learning Classifier

### Project Overview
This repository contains a deep learning project focused on classifying images of cats and dogs. The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between the two animal categories. It also includes a team research paper that details the methodology, model architecture, and experimental results.

### Features
* **Image Classification:** Classifies input images as either a "cat" or a "dog."
* **CNN Model:** Implements a deep learning model from scratch using a TensorFlow/Keras backend.
* **Team Research Paper:** A comprehensive paper is included, which provides insights into the data preprocessing steps, model training, and performance evaluation.

### Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
